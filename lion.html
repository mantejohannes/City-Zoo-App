                <h3>Lion</h3>

                <p>
                The lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>) is one of the most iconic and powerful big cats in the animal kingdom.
                Known as the "king of the jungle," lions are native to parts of Africa and a small population exists in
                the Gir Forest of India. They are the only cats that live in social groups called prides, which usually
                consist of related females, their cubs, and a small number of adult males.
                </p>

                <p>
                Male lions are easily recognised by their majestic manes, which vary in colour and size and serve as a sign
                of maturity and strength. Female lions are the primary hunters in the pride, working together to take down
                prey such as wildebeest, zebras, and antelope.
                </p>

                <p>
                Lions are carnivores and prefer open savannahs and grasslands where they can spot prey from a distance.
                They are also known for spending large portions of the day resting and conserving energy, often active
                only during early mornings and late evenings.
                </p>

                <h4><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></h4>
                <p>You will find the lions at pen <strong>F09</strong>, near the savannah viewpoint area.</p>
