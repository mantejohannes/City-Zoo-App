                <h3>LOST FOREST</h3>

                    <p>
                    Step into the mysterious and lush world of the Lost Forest — a quiet, shaded area filled with dense greenery,
                    hidden creatures, and winding paths. This immersive experience is designed to mimic a tropical rainforest,
                    offering a peaceful escape and a chance to observe some of nature’s most secretive animals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    As you wander through the forest, keep an eye out for lemurs, chameleons, exotic birds, and small forest
                    mammals. The thick canopy above and damp forest floor below provide a cool, calming atmosphere, perfect for
                    both quiet reflection and educational exploration.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Interpretive signs guide you along the trail, sharing stories about rainforest biodiversity, conservation
                    challenges, and the importance of preserving these vital ecosystems.
                    </p>

                    <h4><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</strong></h4>
                    <p>The Lost Forest is located behind the Amphitheatre, tucked between pens <strong>E15</strong> and <strong>F05</strong>.</p>
