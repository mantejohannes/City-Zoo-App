                <h3>Gorilla</h3>

                 <p>
                    Gorillas are the largest primates in the world and are closely related to humans, sharing around 98% of our DNA.
                    There are two main species: the eastern gorilla (<em>Gorilla beringei</em>) and the western gorilla
                    (<em>Gorilla gorilla</em>), with several subspecies under each. They are known for their powerful builds,
                    broad chests, and expressive faces.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Gorillas are intelligent and social animals that live in groups called troops, usually led by a dominant
                    male known as a silverback. They communicate through vocalisations, gestures, and facial expressions.
                    Despite their intimidating appearance, gorillas are generally gentle and shy unless threatened.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    These great apes are herbivores, feeding mainly on leaves, stems, fruits, and bamboo shoots.
                    They inhabit tropical and subtropical forests in central Africa, preferring dense forest areas
                    where food is plentiful and they can build nests for sleeping.
                    </p>

                    <h4><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></h4>
                    <p>You will find the gorillas at pen <strong>D15</strong>, in the forest zone near the primate centre.</p>
