                <h3>Monkeys</h3>

                <p>
                Monkeys are intelligent and agile primates found in a variety of habitats across Africa, Asia, and the Americas.
                They are generally divided into two groups: Old World monkeys (from Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys
                (from Central and South America). These groups differ in features such as nose shape, tail function, and habitat.
                </p>

                <p>
                Monkeys are known for their playful behaviour, social structures, and advanced communication skills. They
                typically live in groups called troops and have complex social hierarchies. Many species use vocal calls,
                facial expressions, and gestures to interact with one another.
                </p>

                <p>
                Their diet is mostly omnivorous, including fruits, leaves, insects, and sometimes small animals.
                Monkeys are highly adaptable and can live in forests, savannahs, or even urban areas. Some species,
                like capuchins and macaques, are known for their tool use and problem-solving abilities.
