                <h3>Koala</h3>

                <p>
                The koala (<em>Phascolarctos cinereus</em>) is a tree-dwelling marsupial native to Australia, easily recognised
                by its large fluffy ears, round nose, and thick grey fur. Despite often being called a “koala bear,”
                koalas are not bears but marsupials, meaning they carry and nurse their young in a pouch.
                </p>

                <p>
                Koalas are herbivores and feed almost exclusively on eucalyptus leaves, which are low in nutrients
                and slightly toxic. To cope with this diet, koalas have a slow metabolism and spend up to 18–20 hours a day
                sleeping or resting to conserve energy.
                </p>

                <p>
                Koalas are solitary animals and live in eucalyptus forests along the eastern and southeastern coasts of Australia.
                They are excellent climbers and rarely come down to the ground. Their strong limbs and sharp claws help them grip
                tree branches and navigate the forest canopy.
                </p>

<h4><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></h4>
<p>You will find the koalas at pen <strong>A05</strong>, in the Australian habitat area.</p>
