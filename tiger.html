                <h3>Tiger</h3>

                <p>
                The tiger (<em>Panthera tigris</em>) is the largest species of the cat family and is easily recognised
                by its striking orange coat with black stripes. Tigers are powerful, solitary hunters found mainly in
                Asia, with populations ranging from the forests of Siberia to the tropical jungles of India and Southeast Asia.
                </p>

                <p>
                Tigers are apex predators and feed primarily on large prey such as deer, wild boar, and buffalo.
                They rely on stealth and strength to ambush their targets, often pouncing with incredible force.
                Each tiger has a unique stripe pattern, which helps with camouflage and individual identification.
                </p>

                <p>
                Although they are solitary by nature, tigers have large home ranges and use scent markings to communicate.
                They are strong swimmers and often cool off or hunt near water sources. Sadly, all tiger subspecies are
                under threat due to habitat loss and poaching, with some already extinct in the wild.
