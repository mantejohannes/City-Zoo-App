                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>

            <p>
            The gemsbok (<em>Oryx gazella</em>) is a large antelope native to arid regions of Southern Africa,
            including the Kalahari Desert. Recognisable by its striking appearance, the gemsbok has long, straight,
            spear-like horns and a bold pattern of black and white facial markings. Both males and females have horns,
            although those of males are typically shorter and thicker.
            </p>

            <p>
            These antelope are well adapted to desert life. They can survive in extremely dry conditions by extracting
            moisture from the plants they eat and can go for long periods without drinking water. Their pale body
            reflects sunlight, while their darker legs help them blend into their shadowed surroundings.
            </p>

            <p>
            Gemsbok are herbivores and feed on grasses, roots, bulbs, and wild fruits. They are typically found in
            open plains, savannahs, and dry scrublands, where they can travel great distances in search of food.
            </p>

            <h4><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></h4>
            <p>You will find the gemsbok at pen <strong>C12</strong>, near the desert habitat exhibit.</p>
