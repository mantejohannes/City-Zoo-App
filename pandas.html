                <h3>Pandas</h3>

                  <p>
                    The giant panda (<em>Ailuropoda melanoleuca</em>) is a beloved bear species native to the mountain forests
                    of central China. Known for its distinctive black and white fur, the panda is a symbol of wildlife
                    conservation and is considered a national treasure in China.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Pandas are unique among bears because their diet is made up almost entirely of bamboo. Despite being
                    classified as carnivores, they have adapted to eat plants and can consume up to 38 kg (84 lb) of bamboo
                    per day. They use their strong jaws and specially adapted wrist bones — which act like thumbs —
                    to grasp and strip bamboo stalks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Pandas are solitary animals that prefer quiet, forested environments. They spend most of their time
                    eating and resting. Due to habitat loss and low birth rates, pandas were once critically endangered,
                    but conservation efforts have helped their populations slowly recover.
