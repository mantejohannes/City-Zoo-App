                <h3>Giraffe</h3>

                    <p>
                    The giraffe (<em>Giraffa camelopardalis</em>) is the tallest land animal on Earth, easily recognised
                    by its long neck, towering legs, and distinctive spotted coat. Giraffes can grow up to 5.5 metres
                    (18 feet) tall, with their necks alone measuring around 2 metres (6 feet). Despite their height,
                    giraffes have the same number of neck vertebrae as most mammals — just seven — though each is greatly elongated.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Their long necks allow them to browse leaves, flowers, and fruits high in trees, particularly from acacia trees,
                    which are a favourite food source. Giraffes use their prehensile tongues, which can be up to 45 cm (18 inches) long,
                    to grasp and strip leaves from branches.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Giraffes are social animals and usually live in loose herds without strong social bonds. They are most commonly
                    found in savannahs, grasslands, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa. Their spotted patterns are unique
                    to each individual and help with camouflage among trees and sunlight.

                    <h4><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></h4>
                    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen <strong>B08</strong>, near the tall acacia trees in the savannah exhibit.</p>
