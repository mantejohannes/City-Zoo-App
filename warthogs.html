                <h3>Warthogs</h3>

                <p>
                The warthog (<em>Phacochoerus africanus</em>) is a wild member of the pig family found in grasslands,
                savannahs, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa. They are easily recognised by their tusks,
                flat snouts, and distinctive facial "warts," which are actually thick pads used for protection during fights.
                </p>

                <p>
                Warthogs are primarily herbivores, feeding on grasses, roots, fruits, and bark. During dry seasons, they may dig
                for bulbs and tubers with their snouts and tusks. Despite their appearance, warthogs are surprisingly fast and can
                run at speeds of up to 50 km/h (31 mph) to escape predators.
                </p>

                <p>
                They often live in burrows, usually taken over from aardvarks, and will back into them to defend themselves
                with their tusks facing outward. Warthogs are social animals, typically living in small family groups known as sounders.
                </p>

                <h4><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></h4>
                <p>You will find the warthogs at pen <strong>E18</strong>, near the African plains area.</p>
